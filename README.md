const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3000/ws/users');

// Handle connection open
socket.onopen = () => {
  console.log('Connected to WebSocket');
};

// Handle incoming messages
socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('User event received:', data);
  
  // Handle different event types
  switch(data.type) {
    case 'created':
      console.log('New user created:', data.user);
      break;
    case 'updated':
      console.log('User updated:', data.user);
      break;
    case 'deleted':
      console.log('User deleted:', data.user);
      break;
  }
};
```

  createdAt: Date;  // Timestamp of creation
}
```

### WebSocket Event

```typescript
type UserEvent = {
  type: 'created' | 'updated' | 'deleted';  // Event type
  user: User;                               // The affected user
};
```
